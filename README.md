A simple desktop klondike solitaire game written in C#. You need Visual Studio (Or a similar app) to run the code.

Note: I don't own the game Idea and I didn't make the images used in the game. I only wrote the code

The game is played like a normal klondike solitaire, but you right click instead of double click to move a card upwards
